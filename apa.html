        GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE Version 2, June 1991
      </p><p>
        Copyright (C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
      </p><p>
        51 Franklin St, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301 USA
      </p><p>
        Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of
        this license document, but changing it is not allowed.
      </p><p>
        Preamble
      </p><p>
        The licenses for most software are designed to take away your
        freedom to share and change it. By contrast, the GNU General
        Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share
        and change free software--to make sure the software is free for
        all its users. This General Public License applies to most of
        the Free Software Foundation's software and to any other program
        whose authors commit to using it. (Some other Free Software
        Foundation software is covered by the GNU Library General Public
        License instead.) You can apply it to your programs, too.
      </p><p>
        When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
        price. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure
        that you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software
        (and charge for this service if you wish), that you receive
        source code or can get it if you want it, that you can change
        the software or use pieces of it in new free programs; and that
        you know you can do these things.
      </p><p>
        To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
        anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the
        rights. These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities
        for you if you distribute copies of the software, or if you
        modify it.
      </p><p>
        For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether
        gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights
        that you have. You must make sure that they, too, receive or can
        get the source code. And you must show them these terms so they
        know their rights.
      </p><p>
        We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the
        software, and (2) offer you this license which gives you legal
        permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the software.
      </p><p>
        Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make
        certain that everyone understands that there is no warranty for
        this free software. If the software is modified by someone else
        and passed on, we want its recipients to know that what they
        have is not the original, so that any problems introduced by
        others will not reflect on the original authors' reputations.
      </p><p>
        Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software
        patents. We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a
        free program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect
        making the program proprietary. To prevent this, we have made it
        clear that any patent must be licensed for everyone's free use
        or not licensed at all.
      </p><p>
        The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
        modification follow.
      </p><p>
        GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING,
        DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION
      </p><p>
        0. This License applies to any program or other work which
        contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may
        be distributed under the terms of this General Public License.
        The "Program", below, refers to any such program or work, and a
        "work based on the Program" means either the Program or any
        derivative work under copyright law: that is to say, a work
        containing the Program or a portion of it, either verbatim or
        with modifications and/or translated into another language.
        (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in the
        term "modification".) Each licensee is addressed as "you".
      </p><p>
        Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are
        not covered by this License; they are outside its scope. The act
        of running the Program is not restricted, and the output from
        the Program is covered only if its contents constitute a work
        based on the Program (independent of having been made by running
        the Program). Whether that is true depends on what the Program
        does.
      </p><p>
        1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's
        source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you
        conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an
        appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep
        intact all the notices that refer to this License and to the
        absence of any warranty; and give any other recipients of the
        Program a copy of this License along with the Program.
      </p><p>
        You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a
        copy, and you may at your option offer warranty protection in
        exchange for a fee.
      </p><p>
        2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any
        portion of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and
        copy and distribute such modifications or work under the terms
        of Section 1 above, provided that you also meet all of these
        conditions:
      </p><p>
        a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices
        stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.
      </p><p>
        b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that
        in whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or
        any part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all
        third parties under the terms of this License.
      </p><p>
        c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively
        when run, you must cause it, when started running for such
        interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an
        announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a
        notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you
        provide a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program
        under these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy
        of this License. (Exception: if the Program itself is
        interactive but does not normally print such an announcement,
        your work based on the Program is not required to print an
        announcement.)
      </p><p>
        These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If
        identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the
        Program, and can be reasonably considered independent and
        separate works in themselves, then this License, and its terms,
        do not apply to those sections when you distribute them as
        separate works. But when you distribute the same sections as
        part of a whole which is a work based on the Program, the
        distribution of the whole must be on the terms of this License,
        whose permissions for other licensees extend to the entire
        whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote
        it.
      </p><p>
        Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or
        contest your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the
        intent is to exercise the right to control the distribution of
        derivative or collective works based on the Program.
      </p><p>
        In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the
        Program with the Program (or with a work based on the Program)
        on a volume of a storage or distribution medium does not bring
        the other work under the scope of this License.
      </p><p>
        3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on
        it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the
        terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of
        the following:
      </p><p>
        a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable
        source code, which must be distributed under the terms of
        Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software
        interchange; or,
      </p><p>
        b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three
        years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your
        cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete
        machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be
        distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a
        medium customarily used for software interchange; or,
      </p><p>
        c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the
        offer to distribute corresponding source code. (This alternative
        is allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you
        received the program in object code or executable form with such
        an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)
      </p><p>
        The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work
        for making modifications to it. For an executable work, complete
        source code means all the source code for all modules it
        contains, plus any associated interface definition files, plus
        the scripts used to control compilation and installation of the
        executable. However, as a special exception, the source code
        distributed need not include anything that is normally
        distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major
        components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system
        on which the executable runs, unless that component itself
        accompanies the executable.
      </p><p>
        If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering
        access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent
        access to copy the source code from the same place counts as
        distribution of the source code, even though third parties are
        not compelled to copy the source along with the object code.
      </p><p>
        4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the
        Program except as expressly provided under this License. Any
        attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the
        Program is void, and will automatically terminate your rights
        under this License. However, parties who have received copies,
        or rights, from you under this License will not have their
        licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in full
        compliance.
      </p><p>
        5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have
        not signed it. However, nothing else grants you permission to
        modify or distribute the Program or its derivative works. These
        actions are prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.
        Therefore, by modifying or distributing the Program (or any work
        based on the Program), you indicate your acceptance of this
        License to do so, and all its terms and conditions for copying,
        distributing or modifying the Program or works based on it.
      </p><p>
        6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on
        the Program), the recipient automatically receives a license
        from the original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the
        Program subject to these terms and conditions. You may not
        impose any further restrictions on the recipients' exercise of
        the rights granted herein. You are not responsible for enforcing
        compliance by third parties to this License.
      </p><p>
        7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of
        patent infringement or for any other reason (not limited to
        patent issues), conditions are imposed on you (whether by court
        order, agreement or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of
        this License, they do not excuse you from the conditions of this
        License. If you cannot distribute so as to satisfy
        simultaneously your obligations under this License and any other
        pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not
        distribute the Program at all. For example, if a patent license
        would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by
        all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you,
        then the only way you could satisfy both it and this License
        would be to refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.
      </p><p>
        If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable
        under any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is
        intended to apply and the section as a whole is intended to
        apply in other circumstances.
      </p><p>
        It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe
        any patents or other property right claims or to contest
        validity of any such claims; this section has the sole purpose
        of protecting the integrity of the free software distribution
        system, which is implemented by public license practices. Many
        people have made generous contributions to the wide range of
        software distributed through that system in reliance on
        consistent application of that system; it is up to the
        author/donor to decide if he or she is willing to distribute
        software through any other system and a licensee cannot impose
        that choice.
      </p><p>
        This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is
        believed to be a consequence of the rest of this License.
      </p><p>
        8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted
        in certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted
        interfaces, the original copyright holder who places the Program
        under this License may add an explicit geographical distribution
        limitation excluding those countries, so that distribution is
        permitted only in or among countries not thus excluded. In such
        case, this License incorporates the limitation as if written in
        the body of this License.
      </p><p>
        9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new
        versions of the General Public License from time to time. Such
        new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version,
        but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.
      </p><p>
        Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the
        Program specifies a version number of this License which applies
        to it and "any later version", you have the option of following
        the terms and conditions either of that version or of any later
        version published by the Free Software Foundation. If the
        Program does not specify a version number of this License, you
        may choose any version ever published by the Free Software
        Foundation.
      </p><p>
        10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other
        free programs whose distribution conditions are different, write
        to the author to ask for permission. For software which is
        copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free
        Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this. Our
        decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free
        status of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting
        the sharing and reuse of software generally.
      </p><p>
        NO WARRANTY
      </p><p>
        11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO
        WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE
        LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT
        HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT
        WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING,
        BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY
        AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE
        QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE
        PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY
        SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.
      </p><p>
        12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO
        IN WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY
        MODIFY AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE
        LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL,
        INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR
        INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS
        OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY
        YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH
        ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN
        ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
      </p><p>
        END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

        sure that you have the freedom to distribute copies of free
        software (and charge for this service if you wish); that you
        receive source code or can get it if you want it; that you can
        change the software and use pieces of it in new free programs;
        and that you are informed that you can do these things.
      </p><p>
        To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
        distributors to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender
        these rights. These restrictions translate to certain
        responsibilities for you if you distribute copies of the library
        or if you modify it.
      </p><p>
        For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether
        gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights
        that we gave you. You must make sure that they, too, receive or
        can get the source code. If you link other code with the
        library, you must provide complete object files to the
        recipients, so that they can relink them with the library after
        making changes to the library and recompiling it. And you must
        show them these terms so they know their rights.
      </p><p>
        We protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we copyright
        the library, and (2) we offer you this license, which gives you
        legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.
      </p><p>
        To protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear that
        there is no warranty for the free library. Also, if the library
        is modified by someone else and passed on, the recipients should
        know that what they have is not the original version, so that
        the original author's reputation will not be affected by
        problems that might be introduced by others.
      </p><p>
        Finally, software patents pose a constant threat to the
        existence of any free program. We wish to make sure that a
        company cannot effectively restrict the users of a free program
        by obtaining a restrictive license from a patent holder.
        Therefore, we insist that any patent license obtained for a
        version of the library must be consistent with the full freedom
        of use specified in this license.
      </p><p>
        Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the
        ordinary GNU General Public License. This license, the GNU
        Lesser General Public License, applies to certain designated
        libraries, and is quite different from the ordinary General
        Public License. We use this license for certain libraries in
        order to permit linking those libraries into non-free programs.
      </p><p>
        When a program is linked with a library, whether statically or
        using a shared library, the combination of the two is legally
        speaking a combined work, a derivative of the original library.
        The ordinary General Public License therefore permits such
        linking only if the entire combination fits its criteria of
        freedom. The Lesser General Public License permits more lax
        criteria for linking other code with the library.
      </p><p>
        We call this license the "Lesser" General Public License because
        it does Less to protect the user's freedom than the ordinary
        General Public License. It also provides other free software
        developers Less of an advantage over competing non-free
        programs. These disadvantages are the reason we use the ordinary
        General Public License for many libraries. However, the Lesser
        license provides advantages in certain special circumstances.
      </p><p>
        For example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need to
        encourage the widest possible use of a certain library, so that
        it becomes a de-facto standard. To achieve this, non-free
        programs must be allowed to use the library. A more frequent
        case is that a free library does the same job as widely used
        non-free libraries. In this case, there is little to gain by
        limiting the free library to free software only, so we use the
        Lesser General Public License.
      </p><p>
        In other cases, permission to use a particular library in
        non-free programs enables a greater number of people to use a
        large body of free software. For example, permission to use the
        GNU C Library in non-free programs enables many more people to
        use the whole GNU operating system, as well as its variant, the
        GNU/Linux operating system.
      </p><p>
        Although the Lesser General Public License is Less protective of
        the users' freedom, it does ensure that the user of a program
        that is linked with the Library has the freedom and the
        wherewithal to run that program using a modified version of the
        Library.
      </p><p>
        The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
        modification follow. Pay close attention to the difference
        between a "work based on the library" and a "work that uses the
        library". The former contains code derived from the library,
        whereas the latter must be combined with the library in order to
        run.
      </p><p>
        GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR
        COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION
      </p><p>
        0. This License Agreement applies to any software library or
        other program which contains a notice placed by the copyright
        holder or other authorized party saying it may be distributed
        under the terms of this Lesser General Public License (also
        called "this License"). Each licensee is addressed as "you".
      </p><p>
        A "library" means a collection of software functions and/or data
        prepared so as to be conveniently linked with application
        programs (which use some of those functions and data) to form
        executables.
      </p><p>
        The "Library", below, refers to any such software library or
        work which has been distributed under these terms. A "work based
        on the Library" means either the Library or any derivative work
        under copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the
        Library or a portion of it, either verbatim or with
        modifications and/or translated straightforwardly into another
        language. (Hereinafter, translation is included without
        limitation in the term "modification".)
      </p><p>
        "Source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work
        for making modifications to it. For a library, complete source
        code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus
        any associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used
        to control compilation and installation of the library.
      </p><p>
        Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are
        not covered by this License; they are outside its scope. The act
        of running a program using the Library is not restricted, and
        output from such a program is covered only if its contents
        constitute a work based on the Library (independent of the use
        of the Library in a tool for writing it). Whether that is true
        depends on what the Library does and what the program that uses
        the Library does.
      </p><p>
        1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's
        complete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided
        that you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an
        appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep
        intact all the notices that refer to this License and to the
        absence of any warranty; and distribute a copy of this License
        along with the Library.
      </p><p>
        You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a
        copy, and you may at your option offer warranty protection in
        exchange for a fee.
      </p><p>
        2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any
        portion of it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and
        copy and distribute such modifications or work under the terms
        of Section 1 above, provided that you also meet all of these
        conditions:
      </p><p>
        a) The modified work must itself be a software library.
      </p><p>
        b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices
        stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.
      </p><p>
        c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no
        charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.
      </p><p>
        d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or
        a table of data to be supplied by an application program that
        uses the facility, other than as an argument passed when the
        facility is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to
        ensure that, in the event an application does not supply such
        function or table, the facility still operates, and performs
        whatever part of its purpose remains meaningful.
      </p><p>
        (For example, a function in a library to compute square roots
        has a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the
        application. Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any
        application-supplied function or table used by this function
        must be optional: if the application does not supply it, the
        square root function must still compute square roots.)
      </p><p>
        These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If
        identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the
        Library, and can be reasonably considered independent and
        separate works in themselves, then this License, and its terms,
        do not apply to those sections when you distribute them as
        separate works. But when you distribute the same sections as
        part of a whole which is a work based on the Library, the
        distribution of the whole must be on the terms of this License,
        whose permissions for other licensees extend to the entire
        whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote
        it.
      </p><p>
        Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or
        contest your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the
        intent is to exercise the right to control the distribution of
        derivative or collective works based on the Library.
      </p><p>
        In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the
        Library with the Library (or with a work based on the Library)
        on a volume of a storage or distribution medium does not bring
        the other work under the scope of this License.
      </p><p>
        3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General
        Public License instead of this License to a given copy of the
        Library. To do this, you must alter all the notices that refer
        to this License, so that they refer to the ordinary GNU General
        Public License, version 2, instead of to this License. (If a
        newer version than version 2 of the ordinary GNU General Public
        License has appeared, then you can specify that version instead
        if you wish.) Do not make any other change in these notices.
      </p><p>
        Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for
        that copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to
        all subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.
      </p><p>
        This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of
        the Library into a program that is not a library.
      </p><p>
        4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or
        derivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable
        form under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you
        accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable
        source code, which must be distributed under the terms of
        Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software
        interchange.
      </p><p>
        If distribution of object code is made by offering access to
        copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to
        copy the source code from the same place satisfies the
        requirement to distribute the source code, even though third
        parties are not compelled to copy the source along with the
        object code.
      </p><p>
        5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the
        Library, but is designed to work with the Library by being
        compiled or linked with it, is called a "work that uses the
        Library". Such a work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of
        the Library, and therefore falls outside the scope of this
        License.
      </p><p>
        However, linking a "work that uses the Library" with the Library
        creates an executable that is a derivative of the Library
        (because it contains portions of the Library), rather than a
        "work that uses the library". The executable is therefore
        covered by this License. Section 6 states terms for distribution
        of such executables.
      </p><p>
        When a "work that uses the Library" uses material from a header
        file that is part of the Library, the object code for the work
        may be a derivative work of the Library even though the source
        code is not. Whether this is true is especially significant if
        the work can be linked without the Library, or if the work is
        itself a library. The threshold for this to be true is not
        precisely defined by law.
      </p><p>
        If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data
        structure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small
        inline functions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of
        the object file is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is
        legally a derivative work. (Executables containing this object
        code plus portions of the Library will still fall under Section
        6.) Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you
        may distribute the object code for the work under the terms of
        Section 6. Any executables containing that work also fall under
        Section 6, whether or not they are linked directly with the
        Library itself.
      </p><p>
        6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also combine
        or link a "work that uses the Library" with the Library to
        produce a work containing portions of the Library, and
        distribute that work under terms of your choice, provided that
        the terms permit modification of the work for the customer's own
        use and reverse engineering for debugging such modifications.
      </p><p>
        You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that
        the Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are
        covered by this License. You must supply a copy of this License.
        If the work during execution displays copyright notices, you
        must include the copyright notice for the Library among them, as
        well as a reference directing the user to the copy of this
        License. Also, you must do one of these things:
      </p><p>
        a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding
        machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever
        changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under
        Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable
        linked with the Library, with the complete machine-readable
        "work that uses the Library", as object code and/or source code,
        so that the user can modify the Library and then relink to
        produce a modified executable containing the modified Library.
        (It is understood that the user who changes the contents of
        definitions files in the Library will not necessarily be able to
        recompile the application to use the modified definitions.)
      </p><p>
        b) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the
        Library. A suitable mechanism is one that (1) uses at run time a
        copy of the library already present on the user's computer
        system, rather than copying library functions into the
        executable, and (2) will operate properly with a modified
        version of the library, if the user installs one, as long as the
        modified version is interface-compatible with the version that
        the work was made with.
      </p><p>
        c) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at least
        three years, to give the same user the materials specified in
        Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more than the cost of
        performing this distribution.
      </p><p>
        d) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to
        copy from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy
        the above specified materials from the same place.
      </p><p>
        e) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these
        materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.
      </p><p>
        For an executable, the required form of the "work that uses the
        Library" must include any data and utility programs needed for
        reproducing the executable from it. However, as a special
        exception, the materials to be distributed need not include
        anything that is normally distributed (in either source or
        binary form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so
        on) of the operating system on which the executable runs, unless
        that component itself accompanies the executable.
      </p><p>
        It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license
        restrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally
        accompany the operating system. Such a contradiction means you
        cannot use both them and the Library together in an executable
        that you distribute.
      </p><p>
        7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the
        Library side-by-side in a single library together with other
        library facilities not covered by this License, and distribute
        such a combined library, provided that the separate distribution
        of the work based on the Library and of the other library
        facilities is otherwise permitted, and provided that you do
        these two things:
      </p><p>
        a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work
        based on the Library, uncombined with any other library
        facilities. This must be distributed under the terms of the
        Sections above.
      </p><p>
        b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact
        that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining
        where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.
      </p><p>
        8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or
        distribute the Library except as expressly provided under this
        License. Any attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link
        with, or distribute the Library is void, and will automatically
        terminate your rights under this License. However, parties who
        have received copies, or rights, from you under this License
        will not have their licenses terminated so long as such parties
        remain in full compliance.
      </p><p>
        9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have
        not signed it. However, nothing else grants you permission to
        modify or distribute the Library or its derivative works. These
        actions are prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.
        Therefore, by modifying or distributing the Library (or any work
        based on the Library), you indicate your acceptance of this
        License to do so, and all its terms and conditions for copying,
        distributing or modifying the Library or works based on it.
      </p><p>
        10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on
        the Library), the recipient automatically receives a license
        from the original licensor to copy, distribute, link with or
        modify the Library subject to these terms and conditions. You
        may not impose any further restrictions on the recipients'
        exercise of the rights granted herein. You are not responsible
        for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.
      </p><p>
        11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of
        patent infringement or for any other reason (not limited to
        patent issues), conditions are imposed on you (whether by court
        order, agreement or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of
        this License, they do not excuse you from the conditions of this
        License. If you cannot distribute so as to satisfy
        simultaneously your obligations under this License and any other
        pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not
        distribute the Library at all. For example, if a patent license
        would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by
        all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you,
        then the only way you could satisfy both it and this License
        would be to refrain entirely from distribution of the Library.
      </p><p>
        If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable
        under any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is
        intended to apply, and the section as a whole is intended to
        apply in other circumstances.
      </p><p>
        It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe
        any patents or other property right claims or to contest
        validity of any such claims; this section has the sole purpose
        of protecting the integrity of the free software distribution
        system which is implemented by public license practices. Many
        people have made generous contributions to the wide range of
        software distributed through that system in reliance on
        consistent application of that system; it is up to the
        author/donor to decide if he or she is willing to distribute
        software through any other system and a licensee cannot impose
        that choice.
      </p><p>
        This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is
        believed to be a consequence of the rest of this License.
      </p><p>
        12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted
        in certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted
        interfaces, the original copyright holder who places the Library
        under this License may add an explicit geographical distribution
        limitation excluding those countries, so that distribution is
        permitted only in or among countries not thus excluded. In such
        case, this License incorporates the limitation as if written in
        the body of this License.
      </p><p>
        13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new
        versions of the Lesser General Public License from time to time.
        Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present
        version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or
        concerns.
      </p><p>
        Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the
        Library specifies a version number of this License which applies
        to it and "any later version", you have the option of following
        the terms and conditions either of that version or of any later
        version published by the Free Software Foundation. If the
        Library does not specify a license version number, you may
        choose any version ever published by the Free Software
        Foundation.
      </p><p>
        14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other
        free programs whose distribution conditions are incompatible
        with these, write to the author to ask for permission. For

      </p><p>
        (b) under Patent Claims infringed by the making, using, or
        selling of Modifications made by that Contributor either alone
        and/or in combination with its Contributor Version (or portions
        of such combination), to make, use, sell, offer for sale, have
        made, and/or otherwise dispose of: 1) Modifications made by that

      </p><p>
        3. Distribution Obligations.
      </p><p>
        3.1. Application of License. The Modifications which You create
        or to which You contribute are governed by the terms of this
        License, including without limitation Section 2.2. The Source
        Code version of Covered Code may be distributed only under the
        terms of this License or a future version of this License
        released under Section 6.1, and You must include a copy of this
        License with every copy of the Source Code You distribute. You
        may not offer or impose any terms on any Source Code version
        that alters or restricts the applicable version of this License
        or the recipients' rights hereunder. However, You may include an
        additional document offering the additional rights described in
        Section 3.5.
      </p><p>
        3.2. Availability of Source Code. Any Modification which You
        create or to which You contribute must be made available in
        Source Code form under the terms of this License either on the
        same media as an Executable version or via an accepted
        Electronic Distribution Mechanism to anyone to whom you made an
        Executable version available; and if made available via
        Electronic Distribution Mechanism, must remain available for at
        least twelve (12) months after the date it initially became
        available, or at least six (6) months after a subsequent version
        of that particular Modification has been made available to such
        recipients. You are responsible for ensuring that the Source
        Code version remains available even if the Electronic
        Distribution Mechanism is maintained by a third party.
      </p><p>
        3.3. Description of Modifications. You must cause all Covered
        Code to which You contribute to contain a file documenting the
        changes You made to create that Covered Code and the date of any
        change. You must include a prominent statement that the
        Modification is derived, directly or indirectly, from Original
        Code provided by the Initial Developer and including the name of
        the Initial Developer in (a) the Source Code, and (b) in any
        notice in an Executable version or related documentation in
        which You describe the origin or ownership of the Covered Code.
      </p><p>
        3.4. Intellectual Property Matters
      </p><p>
        (a) Third Party Claims. If Contributor has knowledge that a
        license under a third party's intellectual property rights is
        required to exercise the rights granted by such Contributor
        under Sections 2.1 or 2.2, Contributor must include a text file
        with the Source Code distribution titled "LEGAL" which describes
        the claim and the party making the claim in sufficient detail
        that a recipient will know whom to contact. If Contributor
        obtains such knowledge after the Modification is made available
        as described in Section 3.2, Contributor shall promptly modify
        the LEGAL file in all copies Contributor makes available
        thereafter and shall take other steps (such as notifying
        appropriate mailing lists or newsgroups) reasonably calculated
        to inform those who received the Covered Code that new knowledge
        has been obtained.
      </p><p>
        (b) Contributor APIs. If Contributor's Modifications include an
        application programming interface and Contributor has knowledge
        of patent licenses which are reasonably necessary to implement
        that API, Contributor must also include this information in the
        LEGAL file.
      </p><p>
        3.5. Required Notices. You must duplicate the notice in Exhibit
        A in each file of the Source Code. If it is not possible to put
        such notice in a particular Source Code file due to its
        structure, then You must include such notice in a location (such
        as a relevant directory) where a user would be likely to look
        for such a notice. If You created one or more Modification(s)
        You may add your name as a Contributor to the notice described
        in Exhibit A. You must also duplicate this License in any
        documentation for the Source Code where You describe recipients'
        rights or ownership rights relating to Covered Code. You may
        choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support,
        indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of
        Covered Code. However, You may do so only on Your own behalf,
        and not on behalf of the Initial Developer or any Contributor.
        You must make it absolutely clear than any such warranty,
        support, indemnity or liability obligation is offered by You
        alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer
        and every Contributor for any liability incurred by the Initial
        Developer or such Contributor as a result of warranty, support,
        indemnity or liability terms You offer.
      </p><p>
        3.6. Distribution of Executable Versions. You may distribute
        Covered Code in Executable form only if the requirements of
        Section 3.1-3.5 have been met for that Covered Code, and if You
        include a notice stating that the Source Code version of the
        Covered Code is available under the terms of this License,
        including a description of how and where You have fulfilled the
        obligations of Section 3.2. The notice must be conspicuously
        included in any notice in an Executable version, related
        documentation or collateral in which You describe recipients'
        rights relating to the Covered Code. You may distribute the
        Executable version of Covered Code or ownership rights under a
        license of Your choice, which may contain terms different from
        this License, provided that You are in compliance with the terms
        of this License and that the license for the Executable version
        does not attempt to limit or alter the recipient's rights in the
        Source Code version from the rights set forth in this License.
        If You distribute the Executable version under a different
        license You must make it absolutely clear that any terms which
        differ from this License are offered by You alone, not by the
        Initial Developer or any Contributor. You hereby agree to
        indemnify the Initial Developer and every Contributor for any
        liability incurred by the Initial Developer or such Contributor
        as a result of any such terms You offer.
      </p><p>
        3.7. Larger Works. You may create a Larger Work by combining
        Covered Code with other code not governed by the terms of this
        License and distribute the Larger Work as a single product. In
        such a case, You must make sure the requirements of this License
        are fulfilled for the Covered Code.
      </p><p>
        4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation.If it is
        impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this
        License with respect to some or all of the Covered Code due to
        statute, judicial order, or regulation then You must: (a) comply
        with the terms of this License to the maximum extent possible;
        and (b) describe the limitations and the code they affect. Such
        description must be included in the LEGAL file described in
        Section 3.4 and must be included with all distributions of the
        Source Code. Except to the extent prohibited by statute or
        regulation, such description must be sufficiently detailed for a
        recipient of ordinary skill to be able to understand it.
      </p><p>
        5. Application of this License. This License applies to code to
        which the Initial Developer has attached the notice in Exhibit A
        and to related Covered Code.
      </p><p>
        6. Versions of the License.
      </p><p>
        6.1. New Versions. Netscape Communications Corporation
        ("Netscape") may publish revised and/or new versions of the
        License from time to time. Each version will be given a
        distinguishing version number.
      </p><p>
        6.2. Effect of New Versions. Once Covered Code has been
        published under a particular version of the License, You may
        always continue to use it under the terms of that version. You
        may also choose to use such Covered Code under the terms of any
        subsequent version of the License published by Netscape. No one
        other than Netscape has the right to modify the terms applicable
        to Covered Code created under this License.
      </p><p>
        6.3. Derivative Works. If You create or use a modified version
        of this License (which you may only do in order to apply it to
        code which is not already Covered Code governed by this
        License), You must (a) rename Your license so that the phrases
        "Mozilla", "MOZILLAPL", "MOZPL", "Netscape", "MPL", "NPL" or any
        confusingly similar phrase do not appear in your license (except
        to note that your license differs from this License) and (b)
        otherwise make it clear that Your version of the license
        contains terms which differ from the Mozilla Public License and
        Netscape Public License. (Filling in the name of the Initial
        Developer, Original Code or Contributor in the notice described
        in Exhibit A shall not of themselves be deemed to be
        modifications of this License.)
      </p><p>
        7. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY.
      </p><p>
        COVERED CODE IS PROVIDED UNDER THIS LICENSE ON AN "AS IS" BASIS,
        WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED,
        INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES THAT THE COVERED CODE
        IS FREE OF DEFECTS, MERCHANTABLE, FIT FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE
        OR NON-INFRINGING. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND
        PERFORMANCE OF THE COVERED CODE IS WITH YOU. SHOULD ANY COVERED
        CODE PROVE DEFECTIVE IN ANY RESPECT, YOU (NOT THE INITIAL
        DEVELOPER OR ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR) ASSUME THE COST OF ANY
        NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION. THIS DISCLAIMER OF
        WARRANTY CONSTITUTES AN ESSENTIAL PART OF THIS LICENSE. NO USE
        OF ANY COVERED CODE IS AUTHORIZED HEREUNDER EXCEPT UNDER THIS
        DISCLAIMER.
      </p><p>
        8. TERMINATION.
      </p><p>
        8.1. This License and the rights granted hereunder will
        terminate automatically if You fail to comply with terms herein
        and fail to cure such breach within 30 days of becoming aware of
        the breach. All sublicenses to the Covered Code which are
        properly granted shall survive any termination of this License.
        Provisions which, by their nature, must remain in effect beyond
        the termination of this License shall survive.
      </p><p>
        8.2. If You initiate litigation by asserting a patent
        infringement claim (excluding declaratory judgment actions)
        against Initial Developer or a Contributor (the Initial
        Developer or Contributor against whom You file such action is
        referred to as "Participant") alleging that:
      </p><p>
        (a) such Participant's Contributor Version directly or
        indirectly infringes any patent, then any and all rights granted
        by such Participant to You under Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 of this
        License shall, upon 60 days notice from Participant terminate
        prospectively, unless if within 60 days after receipt of notice
        You either: (i) agree in writing to pay Participant a mutually
        agreeable reasonable royalty for Your past and future use of
        Modifications made by such Participant, or (ii) withdraw Your
        litigation claim with respect to the Contributor Version against
        such Participant. If within 60 days of notice, a reasonable
        royalty and payment arrangement are not mutually agreed upon in
        writing by the parties or the litigation claim is not withdrawn,
        the rights granted by Participant to You under Sections 2.1
        and/or 2.2 automatically terminate at the expiration of the 60
        day notice period specified above.
      </p><p>
        (b) any software, hardware, or device, other than such
        Participant's Contributor Version, directly or indirectly
        infringes any patent, then any rights granted to You by such
        Participant under Sections 2.1(b) and 2.2(b) are revoked
        effective as of the date You first made, used, sold,
        distributed, or had made, Modifications made by that
        Participant.
      </p><p>
        8.3. If You assert a patent infringement claim against
        Participant alleging that such Participant's Contributor Version
        directly or indirectly infringes any patent where such claim is
        resolved (such as by license or settlement) prior to the
        initiation of patent infringement litigation, then the
        reasonable value of the licenses granted by such Participant
        under Sections 2.1 or 2.2 shall be taken into account in
        determining the amount or value of any payment or license.
      </p><p>
        8.4. In the event of termination under Sections 8.1 or 8.2
        above, all end user license agreements (excluding distributors
        and resellers) which have been validly granted by You or any
        distributor hereunder prior to termination shall survive
        termination.
      </p><p>
        9. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY. UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO
        LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT, OR
        OTHERWISE, SHALL YOU, THE INITIAL DEVELOPER, ANY OTHER
        CONTRIBUTOR, OR ANY DISTRIBUTOR OF COVERED CODE, OR ANY SUPPLIER
        OF ANY OF SUCH PARTIES, BE LIABLE TO ANY PERSON FOR ANY
        INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY
        CHARACTER INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF
        GOODWILL, WORK STOPPAGE, COMPUTER FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION, OR ANY
        AND ALL OTHER COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES, EVEN IF SUCH PARTY
        SHALL HAVE BEEN INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
        THIS LIMITATION OF LIABILITY SHALL NOT APPLY TO LIABILITY FOR
        DEATH OR PERSONAL INJURY RESULTING FROM SUCH PARTY'S NEGLIGENCE
        TO THE EXTENT APPLICABLE LAW PROHIBITS SUCH LIMITATION. SOME
        JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF

        10. U.S. GOVERNMENT END USERS. The Covered Code is a "commercial
        item," as that term is defined in 48 C.F.R. 2.101 (Oct. 1995),
        consisting of "commercial computer software" and "commercial
        computer software documentation," as such terms are used in 48
        C.F.R. 12.212 (Sept. 1995). Consistent with 48 C.F.R. 12.212 and
        48 C.F.R. 227.7202-1 through 227.7202-4 (June 1995), all U.S.
        Government End Users acquire Covered Code with only those rights
        set forth herein.
      </p><p>
        11. MISCELLANEOUS. This License represents the complete
        agreement concerning subject matter hereof. If any provision of
        this License is held to be unenforceable, such provision shall
        be reformed only to the extent necessary to make it enforceable.
        This License shall be governed by California law provisions
        (except to the extent applicable law, if any, provides
        otherwise), excluding its conflict-of-law provisions. With
        respect to disputes in which at least one party is a citizen of,
        or an entity chartered or registered to do business in the
        United States of America, any litigation relating to this
        License shall be subject to the jurisdiction of the Federal
        Courts of the Northern District of California, with venue lying
        in Santa Clara County, California, with the losing party
        responsible for costs, including without limitation, court costs
        and reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses. The application of
        the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International
        Sale of Goods is expressly excluded. Any law or regulation which
        provides that the language of a contract shall be construed
        against the drafter shall not apply to this License.
      </p><p>
        12. RESPONSIBILITY FOR CLAIMS. As between Initial Developer and
        the Contributors, each party is responsible for claims and
        damages arising, directly or indirectly, out of its utilization
        of rights under this License and You agree to work with Initial
        Developer and Contributors to distribute such responsibility on
        an equitable basis. Nothing herein is intended or shall be
        deemed to constitute any admission of liability.
      </p><p>
        13. MULTIPLE-LICENSED CODE. Initial Developer may designate
        portions of the Covered Code as "Multiple-Licensed".
        "Multiple-Licensed" means that the Initial Developer permits you
        to utilize portions of the Covered Code under Your choice of the
        NPL or the alternative licenses, if any, specified by the
        Initial Developer in the file described in Exhibit A.

      </p><p>
        2.1. The Initial Developer Grant.
      </p><p>
        The Initial Developer hereby grants You a world-wide,
        royalty-free, non-exclusive license, subject to third party
        intellectual property claims:
      </p><p>
        (a) under intellectual property rights (other than patent or
        trademark) Licensable by Initial Developer to use, reproduce,
        modify, display, perform, sublicense and distribute the Original
        Code (or portions thereof) with or without Modifications, and/or
        as part of a Larger Work; and

        (b) under patents now or hereafter owned or controlled by
        Initial Developer, to make, have made, use and sell ("offer to
        sell and import") the Original Code, Modifications, or portions
        thereof, but solely to the extent that any such patent is
        reasonably necessary to enable You to utilize, alone or in
        combination with other software, the Original Code,
        Modifications, or any combination or portions thereof.
      </p><p>
        (c)

        (a) under intellectual property rights (other than patent or

        and/or as part of a Larger Work; and
      </p><p>
        (b) under patents now or hereafter owned or controlled by
        Contributor, to make, have made, use and sell ("offer to sell
        and import") the Contributor Version (or portions thereof), but

        necessary to enable You to utilize, alone or in combination with
        other software, the Contributor Version (or portions thereof).
      </p><p>
        (c)
      </p><p>
        (d)
      </p><p>
        3 DISTRIBUTION OBLIGATIONS.
      </p><p>
        3.1. Application of License.
      </p><p>
        The Modifications which You create or to which You contribute
        are governed by the terms of this License, including without
        limitation Section 2.2. The Source Code version of Covered Code
        may be distributed only under the terms of this License or a
        future version of this License released under Section 6.1, and
        You must include a copy of this License with every copy of the
        Source Code You distribute. You may not offer or impose any
        terms on any Source Code version that alters or restricts the
        applicable version of this License or the recipients' rights
        hereunder. However, You may include an additional document
        offering the additional rights described in Section 3.5.
      </p><p>
        3.2. Availability of Source Code.
      </p><p>
        Any Modification created by You will be provided to the Initial
        Developer in Source Code form and are subject to the terms of
        the License. 3.3. Description of Modifications.
      </p><p>
        You must cause all Covered Code to which You contribute to
        contain a file documenting the changes You made to create that
        Covered Code and the date of any change. You must include a
        prominent statement that the Modification is derived, directly
        or indirectly, from Original Code provided by the Initial
        Developer and including the name of the Initial Developer in (a)
        the Source Code, and (b) in any notice in an Executable version
        or related documentation in which You describe the origin or
        ownership of the Covered Code.
      </p><p>
        3.4. Intellectual Property Matters.
      </p><p>
        (a) Third Party Claims. If Contributor has knowledge that a
        license under a third party's intellectual property rights is
        required to exercise the rights granted by such Contributor
        under Sections 2.1 or 2.2, Contributor must include a text file
        with the Source Code distribution titled "LEGAL" which describes
        the claim and the party making the claim in sufficient detail
        that a recipient will know whom to contact. If Contributor
        obtains such knowledge after the Modification is made available
        as described in Section 3.2, Contributor shall promptly modify
        the LEGAL file in all copies Contributor makes available
        thereafter and shall take other steps (such as notifying
        appropriate mailing lists or newsgroups) reasonably calculated
        to inform those who received the Covered Code that new knowledge
        has been obtained.
      </p><p>
        (b) Contributor APIs. If Contributor's Modifications include an
        application programming interface and Contributor has knowledge
        of patent licenses which are reasonably necessary to implement
        that API, Contributor must also include this information in the
        LEGAL file.
      </p><p>
        (c) Representations. Contributor represents that, except as
        disclosed pursuant to Section 3.4(a) above, Contributor believes
        that Contributor's Modifications are Contributor's original
        creation(s) and/or Contributor has sufficient rights to grant
        the rights conveyed by this License.
      </p><p>
        3.5. Required Notices. You must duplicate the notice in Exhibit
        A in each file of the Source Code. If it is not possible to put
        such notice in a particular Source Code file due to its
        structure, then You must include such notice in a location (such
        as a relevant directory) where a user would be likely to look
        for such a notice. If You created one or more Modification(s)
        You may add your name as a Contributor to the notice described
        in Exhibit A. You must also duplicate this License in any
        documentation for the Source Code where You describe recipients'
        rights or ownership rights relating to Covered Code. You may
        choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support,
        indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of
        Covered Code. However, You may do so only on Your own behalf,
        and not on behalf of the Initial Developer or any Contributor.
      </p><p>
        3.6. Distribution of Executable Versions. You may distribute
        Covered Code in Executable form only if the requirements of
        Section 3.1-3.5 have been met for that Covered Code. You may
        distribute the Executable version of Covered Code or ownership
        rights under a license of Your choice, which may contain terms
        different from this License, provided that You are in compliance
        with the terms of this License and that the license for the
        Executable version does not attempt to limit or alter the
        recipient's rights in the Source Code version from the rights
        set forth in this License. If You distribute the Executable
        version under a different license You must make it absolutely
        clear that any terms which differ from this License are offered
        by You alone, not by the Initial Developer or any Contributor.
        If you distribute executable versions containing Covered Code as
        part of a product, you must reproduce the notice in Exhibit B in
        the documentation and/or other materials provided with the
        product.
      </p><p>
        3.7. Larger Works. You may create a Larger Work by combining
        Covered Code with other code not governed by the terms of this
        License and distribute the Larger Work as a single product. In
        such a case, You must make sure the requirements of this License
        are fulfilled for the Covered Code.
      </p><p>
        3.8. Restrictions. You may not remove any product
        identification, copyright, proprietary notices or labels from
        gSOAP.
      </p><p>
        4 INABILITY TO COMPLY DUE TO STATUTE OR REGULATION.
      </p><p>
        If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of
        this License with respect to some or all of the Covered Code due
        to statute, judicial order, or regulation then You must: (a)
        comply with the terms of this License to the maximum extent
        possible; and (b) describe the limitations and the code they
        affect. Such description must be included in the LEGAL file
        described in Section 3.4 and must be included with all
        distributions of the Source Code. Except to the extent
        prohibited by statute or regulation, such description must be
        sufficiently detailed for a recipient of ordinary skill to be
        able to understand it.
      </p><p>
        5 APPLICATION OF THIS LICENSE.
      </p><p>
        This License applies to code to which the Initial Developer has
        attached the notice in Exhibit A and to related Covered Code.
      </p><p>
        6 VERSIONS OF THE LICENSE.
      </p><p>
        6.1. New Versions.
      </p><p>
        Grantor may publish revised and/or new versions of the License
        from time to time. Each version will be given a distinguishing
        version number.
      </p><p>
        6.2. Effect of New Versions.
      </p><p>
        Once Covered Code has been published under a particular version
        of the License, You may always continue to use it under the
        terms of that version. You may also choose to use such Covered
        Code under the terms of any subsequent version of the License.
      </p><p>
        6.3. Derivative Works.
      </p><p>
        If You create or use a modified version of this License (which
        you may only do in order to apply it to code which is not
        already Covered Code governed by this License), You must (a)
        rename Your license so that the phrase "gSOAP" or any
        confusingly similar phrase do not appear in your license (except
        to note that your license differs from this License) and (b)
        otherwise make it clear that Your version of the license
        contains terms which differ from the gSOAP Public License.
        (Filling in the name of the Initial Developer, Original Code or
        Contributor in the notice described in Exhibit A shall not of
        themselves be deemed to be modifications of this License.)
      </p><p>

        ARISING OUT OF OR IN ANY WAY RELATED TO THE SOFTWARE, EVEN IF
        THE AUTHORS HAVE BEEN ADVISED ON THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGE
        OR IF SUCH DAMAGE COULD HAVE BEEN REASONABLY FORESEEN, AND
        NOTWITHSTANDING ANY FAILURE OF ESSENTIAL PURPOSE OF ANY
        EXCLUSIVE REMEDY PROVIDED. SUCH LIMITATION ON DAMAGES INCLUDES,
        BUT IS NOT LIMITED TO, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF GOODWILL, LOST

        SOFTWARE MAY RESULT DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY IN PHYSICAL INJURY OR
        LOSS OF HUMAN LIFE. THIS DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY CONSTITUTES AN
        ESSENTIAL PART OF THIS LICENSE. NO USE OF ANY COVERED CODE IS

        8 TERMINATION.
      </p><p>
        8.1.
      </p><p>
        This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate
        automatically if You fail to comply with terms herein and fail
        to cure such breach within 30 days of becoming aware of the
        breach. All sublicenses to the Covered Code which are properly
        granted shall survive any termination of this License.
        Provisions which, by their nature, must remain in effect beyond
        the termination of this License shall survive.
      </p><p>
        8.2.
      </p><p>
        8.3.
      </p><p>
        If You assert a patent infringement claim against Participant
        alleging that such Participant's Contributor Version directly or
        indirectly infringes any patent where such claim is resolved
        (such as by license or settlement) prior to the initiation of
        patent infringement litigation, then the reasonable value of the
        licenses granted by such Participant under Sections 2.1 or 2.2
        shall be taken into account in determining the amount or value
        of any payment or license.
      </p><p>
        8.4. In the event of termination under Sections 8.1 or 8.2
        above, all end user license agreements (excluding distributors
        and resellers) which have been validly granted by You or any
        distributor hereunder prior to termination shall survive
        termination.
      </p><p>
        9 LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.
      </p><p>
        UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER TORT
        (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL YOU, THE
        INITIAL DEVELOPER, ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR, OR ANY DISTRIBUTOR OF
        COVERED CODE, OR ANY SUPPLIER OF ANY OF SUCH PARTIES, BE LIABLE
        TO ANY PERSON FOR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR
        CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY CHARACTER INCLUDING, WITHOUT
        LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF GOODWILL, WORK STOPPAGE,
        COMPUTER FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND ALL OTHER COMMERCIAL
        DAMAGES OR LOSSES, EVEN IF SUCH PARTY SHALL HAVE BEEN INFORMED
        OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. THIS LIMITATION OF LIABILITY
        SHALL NOT APPLY TO LIABILITY FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL INJURY
        RESULTING FROM SUCH PARTY'S NEGLIGENCE TO THE EXTENT APPLICABLE
        LAW PROHIBITS SUCH LIMITATION. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW
        THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL
        DAMAGES, SO THIS EXCLUSION AND LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.

      </p><p>
        As between Initial Developer and the Contributors, each party is
        responsible for claims and damages arising, directly or
        indirectly, out of its utilization of rights under this License
        and You agree to work with Initial Developer and Contributors to

        herein is intended or shall be deemed to constitute any
        admission of liability.

        (1) If any part of the source code for this software is

        These conditions apply to any software derived from or based on

        ansi2knr.c is included in this distribution by permission of L.
        Peter Deutsch, sole proprietor of its copyright holder, Aladdin
        Enterprises of Menlo Park, CA. ansi2knr.c is NOT covered by the
        above copyright and conditions, but instead by the usual
        distribution terms of the Free Software Foundation; principally,
        that you must include source code if you redistribute it. (See
        the file ansi2knr.c for full details.) However, since ansi2knr.c
        is not needed as part of any program generated from the IJG
        code, this does not limit you more than the foregoing paragraphs
        do.
      </p><p>
        The Unix configuration script "configure" was produced with GNU
        Autoconf. It is copyright by the Free Software Foundation but is
        freely distributable. The same holds for its supporting scripts
        (config.guess, config.sub, ltmain.sh). Another support script,
        install-sh, is copyright by X Consortium but is also freely
        distributable.
      </p><p>
        The IJG distribution formerly included code to read and write
        GIF files. To avoid entanglement with the Unisys LZW patent, GIF
        reading support has been removed altogether, and the GIF writer
        has been simplified to produce "uncompressed GIFs". This
        technique does not use the LZW algorithm; the resulting GIF
        files are larger than usual, but are readable by all standard
        GIF decoders.

        PCRE is a library of functions to support regular expressions
        whose syntax and semantics are as close as possible to those of
        the Perl 5 language.
      </p><p>
        Release 8 of PCRE is distributed under the terms of the "BSD"
        licence, as specified below. The documentation for PCRE,
        supplied in the "doc" directory, is distributed under the same
        terms as the software itself.
      </p><p>
        The basic library functions are written in C and are
        freestanding. Also included in the distribution is a set of C++
        wrapper functions, and a just-in-time compiler that can be used
        to optimize pattern matching. These are both optional features
        that can be omitted when the library is built.

        December 11, 2001
      </p><p>
        The FLTK library and included programs are provided under the
        terms of the GNU Library General Public License (LGPL) with the
        following exceptions:
      </p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>
            Modifications to the FLTK configure script, config header
            file, and makefiles by themselves to support a specific
            platform do not constitute a modified or derivative work.
          </p><p>
            The authors do request that such modifications be
            contributed to the FLTK project - send all contributions
            through the "Software Trouble Report" on the following page:
          </p><p>
            http://www.fltk.org/str.php
          </p></li><li><p>
            Widgets that are subclassed from FLTK widgets do not
            constitute a derivative work.
          </p></li><li><p>
            Static linking of applications and widgets to the FLTK
            library does not constitute a derivative work and does not
            require the author to provide source code for the
            application or widget, use the shared FLTK libraries, or
            link their applications or widgets against a user-supplied
            version of FLTK.
          </p><p>
            If you link the application or widget to a modified version
            of FLTK, then the changes to FLTK must be provided under the
            terms of the LGPL in sections 1, 2, and 4.
          </p></li><li><p>
            You do not have to provide a copy of the FLTK license with
            programs that are linked to the FLTK library, nor do you
            have to identify the FLTK license in your program or
            documentation as required by section 6 of the LGPL.
          </p><p>
            However, programs must still identify their use of FLTK. The
            following example statement can be included in user
            documentation to satisfy this requirement:
          </p><p>
            [program/widget] is based in part on the work of the FLTK
            project (http://www.fltk.org).

          The FreeType Project is distributed in several archive
          packages; some of them may contain, in addition to the
          FreeType font engine, various tools and contributions which
          rely on, or relate to, the FreeType Project.
        </p><p>
          This license applies to all files found in such packages, and
          which do not fall under their own explicit license. The
          license affects thus the FreeType font engine, the test
          programs, documentation and makefiles, at the very least.
        </p><p>
          This license was inspired by the BSD, Artistic, and IJG
          (Independent JPEG Group) licenses, which all encourage
          inclusion and use of free software in commercial and freeware
          products alike. As a consequence, its main points are that:
        </p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
              We don't promise that this software works. However, we
              will be interested in any kind of bug reports. (`as is'
              distribution)
            </p></li><li><p>
              You can use this software for whatever you want, in parts
              or full form, without having to pay us. (`royalty-free'
              usage)
            </p></li><li><p>
              You may not pretend that you wrote this software. If you
              use it, or only parts of it, in a program, you must
              acknowledge somewhere in your documentation that you have
              used the FreeType code. (`credits')
            </p></li></ul></div><p>
          We specifically permit and encourage the inclusion of this
          software, with or without modifications, in commercial
          products. We disclaim all warranties covering The FreeType
          Project and assume no liability related to The FreeType
          Project.
        </p><p>
          Finally, many people asked us for a preferred form for a
          credit/disclaimer to use in compliance with this license. We
          thus encourage you to use the following text:

          Throughout this license, the terms `package', `FreeType

          originally distributed by the authors (David Turner, Robert
          Wilhelm, and Werner Lemberg) as the `FreeType Project', be
          they named as alpha, beta or final release.
        </p><p>
          `You' refers to the licensee, or person using the project,
          where `using' is a generic term including compiling the
          project's source code as well as linking it to form a
          `program' or `executable'. This program is referred to as `a
          program using the FreeType engine'.

          This license applies to all files distributed in the original
          FreeType Project, including all source code, binaries and
