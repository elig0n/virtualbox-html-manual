    This chapter provides additional information for readers who are
    familiar with computer architecture and technology and wish to find
    out more about how Oracle VM VirtualBox works <span class="emphasis"><em>under the
    hood</em></span>. The contents of this chapter are not required
    reading in order to use Oracle VM VirtualBox successfully.
  </p><div class="sect1" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="vboxconfigdata"></a>10.1. Where Oracle VM VirtualBox Stores its Files</h2></div></div></div><p>
      In Oracle VM VirtualBox, a virtual machine and its settings are
      described in a virtual machine settings file in XML format. In
      addition, most virtual machines have one or more virtual hard
      disks. These are typically represented by disk images, such as
      those in VDI format. The location of these files may vary,
      depending on the host operating system. See
      <a href="ch10.html#vboxconfigdata-machine-folder" title="10.1.1. The Machine Folder">Section 10.1.1, &#8220;The Machine Folder&#8221;</a>.
    </p><p>
      Global configuration data for Oracle VM VirtualBox is maintained in
      another location on the host. See
      <a href="ch10.html#vboxconfigdata-global" title="10.1.2. Global Settings">Section 10.1.2, &#8220;Global Settings&#8221;</a>.
    </p><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="vboxconfigdata-machine-folder"></a>10.1.1. The Machine Folder</h3></div></div></div><p>
        By default, each virtual machine has a directory on your host
        computer where all the files of that machine are stored: the XML
        settings file, with a <code class="filename">.vbox</code> file extension,
        and its disk images. This is called the <span class="emphasis"><em>machine
        folder</em></span>.
      </p><p>
        By default, this machine folder is located in a common folder
        called <code class="filename">VirtualBox VMs</code>, which Oracle VM VirtualBox
        creates in the current system user's home directory. The
        location of this home directory depends on the conventions of
        the host operating system, as follows:
      </p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
            On Windows, this is the location returned by the
            <code class="literal">SHGetFolderPath</code> function of the Windows
            system library Shell32.dll, asking for the user profile. A
            typical location is
            <code class="filename">C:\Users\<em class="replaceable"><code>username</code></em></code>.
          </p></li><li><p>
            On Linux, Mac OS X, and Oracle Solaris, this is generally
            taken from the environment variable
            <code class="filename">$HOME</code>, except for the user
            <code class="literal">root</code> where it is taken from the account
            database. This is a workaround for the frequent trouble
            caused by users using Oracle VM VirtualBox in combination with the
            tool <span><strong class="command">sudo</strong></span>, which by default does not
            reset the environment variable <code class="filename">$HOME</code>.
          </p><p>
            A typical location on Linux and Oracle Solaris is
            <code class="filename">/home/<em class="replaceable"><code>username</code></em></code>
            and on Mac OS X is
            <code class="filename">/Users/<em class="replaceable"><code>username</code></em></code>.
          </p></li></ul></div><p>
        For simplicity, we abbreviate the location of the home directory
        as <code class="filename">$HOME</code>. Using that convention, the common
        folder for all virtual machines is <code class="filename">$HOME/VirtualBox
        VMs</code>.
      </p><p>
        As an example, when you create a virtual machine called "Example
        VM", Oracle VM VirtualBox creates the following:
      </p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
            A machine folder: <code class="filename">$HOME/VirtualBox VMs/Example
            VM/</code>
          </p></li><li><p>
            In the machine folder, a settings file: <code class="filename">Example
            VM.vbox</code>
          </p></li><li><p>
            In the machine folder, a virtual disk image:
            <code class="filename">Example VM.vdi</code>.
          </p></li></ul></div><p>
        This is the default layout if you use the
        <span class="bold"><strong>Create New Virtual Machine</strong></span>
        wizard described in <a href="ch01.html#gui-createvm" title="1.7. Creating Your First Virtual Machine">Section 1.7, &#8220;Creating Your First Virtual Machine&#8221;</a>. Once you
        start working with the VM, additional files are added. Log files
        are in a subfolder called <code class="filename">Logs</code>, and if you
        have taken snapshots, they are in a
        <code class="filename">Snapshots</code> subfolder. For each VM, you can
        change the location of its snapshots folder in the VM settings.
      </p><p>
        You can change the default machine folder by selecting
        <span class="bold"><strong>Preferences</strong></span> from the
        <span class="bold"><strong>File</strong></span> menu in the Oracle VM VirtualBox
        main window. Then, in the displayed window, click on the
        <span class="bold"><strong>General</strong></span> tab. Alternatively, use
        the <span><strong class="command">VBoxManage setproperty machinefolder</strong></span>
        command. See <a href="ch08.html#vboxmanage-setproperty" title="8.29. VBoxManage setproperty">Section 8.29, &#8220;VBoxManage setproperty&#8221;</a>.
      </p></div><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="vboxconfigdata-global"></a>10.1.2. Global Settings</h3></div></div></div><p>
        In addition to the files for the virtual machines,
        Oracle VM VirtualBox maintains global configuration data in the
        following directory:
      </p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
            <span class="bold"><strong>Linux and Oracle Solaris:</strong></span>
            <code class="filename">$HOME/.config/VirtualBox</code>.
          </p></li><li><p>
            <span class="bold"><strong>Windows:</strong></span>
            <code class="filename">$HOME/.VirtualBox</code>.
          </p></li><li><p>
            <span class="bold"><strong>Mac OS X:</strong></span>
            <code class="filename">$HOME/Library/VirtualBox</code>.
          </p></li></ul></div><p>
        Oracle VM VirtualBox creates this configuration directory
        automatically, if necessary. You can specify an alternate
        configuration directory by either setting the
        <code class="literal">VBOX_USER_HOME</code> environment variable, or on
        Linux or Oracle Solaris by using the standard
        <code class="literal">XDG_CONFIG_HOME</code> variable. Since the global
        <code class="filename">VirtualBox.xml</code> settings file points to all
        other configuration files, this enables switching between
        several Oracle VM VirtualBox configurations.
      </p><p>
        In this configuration directory, Oracle VM VirtualBox stores its
        global settings file, an XML file called
        <code class="filename">VirtualBox.xml</code>. This file includes global
        configuration options and a list of registered virtual machines
        with pointers to their XML settings files.
      </p></div><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="vboxconfigdata-summary-locations"></a>10.1.3. Summary of Configuration Data Locations</h3></div></div></div><p>

                  Media registration is done automatically when a

        Oracle VM VirtualBox uses XML for both the machine settings files and
        the global configuration file,
        <code class="filename">VirtualBox.xml</code>.
      </p><p>
        All Oracle VM VirtualBox XML files are versioned. When a new settings
        file is created, for example because a new virtual machine is
        created, Oracle VM VirtualBox automatically uses the settings format
        of the current Oracle VM VirtualBox version. These files may not be
        readable if you downgrade to an earlier version of
        Oracle VM VirtualBox. However, when Oracle VM VirtualBox encounters a
        settings file from an earlier version, such as after upgrading
        Oracle VM VirtualBox, it attempts to preserve the settings format as
        much as possible. It will only silently upgrade the settings
        format if the current settings cannot be expressed in the old
        format, for example because you enabled a feature that was not
        present in an earlier version of Oracle VM VirtualBox.
      </p><p>
        In such cases, Oracle VM VirtualBox backs up the old settings file in
        the virtual machine's configuration directory. If you need to go
        back to the earlier version of Oracle VM VirtualBox, then you will
        need to manually copy these backup files back.
      </p><p>
        We intentionally do not document the specifications of the
        Oracle VM VirtualBox XML files, as we must reserve the right to modify
        them in the future. We therefore strongly suggest that you do
        not edit these files manually. Oracle VM VirtualBox provides complete
        access to its configuration data through its the
        <span><strong class="command">VBoxManage</strong></span> command line tool, see
        <a href="ch08.html" title="Chapter 8. VBoxManage">Chapter 8, <i>VBoxManage</i></a> and its API, see
        <a href="ch11.html" title="Chapter 11. Oracle VM VirtualBox Programming Interfaces">Chapter 11, <i>Oracle VM VirtualBox Programming Interfaces</i></a>.
      </p></div></div><div class="sect1" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="technical-components"></a>10.2. Oracle VM VirtualBox Executables and Components</h2></div></div></div><p>
      Oracle VM VirtualBox was designed to be modular and flexible. When the
      Oracle VM VirtualBox graphical user interface (GUI) is opened and a VM
      is started, at least the following three processes are running:
    </p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
          <span><strong class="command">VBoxSVC</strong></span>, the Oracle VM VirtualBox service process
          which always runs in the background. This process is started
          automatically by the first Oracle VM VirtualBox client process and
          exits a short time after the last client exits. The first
          Oracle VM VirtualBox service can be the GUI,
          <span><strong class="command">VBoxManage</strong></span>,
          <span><strong class="command">VBoxHeadless</strong></span>, the web service amongst
          others. The service is responsible for bookkeeping,
          maintaining the state of all VMs, and for providing
          communication between Oracle VM VirtualBox components. This
          communication is implemented using COM/XPCOM.
        </p><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title">Note</h3><p>
            When we refer to <span class="emphasis"><em>clients</em></span> here, we mean
            the local clients of a particular <span><strong class="command">VBoxSVC</strong></span>
            server process, not clients in a network. Oracle VM VirtualBox
            employs its own client/server design to allow its processes
            to cooperate, but all these processes run under the same
            user account on the host operating system, and this is
            totally transparent to the user.
          </p></div></li><li><p>
          The GUI process, <span><strong class="command">VirtualBoxVM</strong></span>, a client
          application based on the cross-platform Qt library. When
          started without the <code class="option">--startvm</code> option, this
          application acts as the VirtualBox Manager, displaying the VMs
          and their settings. It then communicates settings and state
          changes to <span><strong class="command">VBoxSVC</strong></span> and also reflects
          changes effected through other means, such as the
          <span><strong class="command">VBoxManage</strong></span> command.
        </p></li><li><p>
          If the <span><strong class="command">VirtualBoxVM</strong></span> client application is
          started with the <code class="option">--startvm</code> argument, it loads
          the VMM library which includes the actual hypervisor and then
          runs a virtual machine and provides the input and output for
          the guest.
        </p></li></ul></div><p>
      Any Oracle VM VirtualBox front-end, or client, will communicate with the
      service process and can both control and reflect the current
      state. For example, either the VM selector or the VM window or
      VBoxManage can be used to pause the running VM, and other
      components will always reflect the changed state.
    </p><p>
      The Oracle VM VirtualBox GUI application is only one of several
      available front ends, or clients. The complete list shipped with
      Oracle VM VirtualBox is as follows:
    </p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
          <span><strong class="command">VirtualBoxVM</strong></span>: The Qt front end implementing
          the VirtualBox Manager and running VMs.
        </p></li><li><p>
          <span><strong class="command">VBoxManage</strong></span>: A less user-friendly but more
          powerful alternative. See <a href="ch08.html" title="Chapter 8. VBoxManage">Chapter 8, <i>VBoxManage</i></a>.
        </p></li><li><p>
          <span><strong class="command">VBoxHeadless</strong></span>: A VM front end which does not
          directly provide any video output and keyboard or mouse input,
          but enables redirection through the VirtualBox Remote Desktop
          Extension. See <a href="ch07.html#vboxheadless" title="7.1.2. VBoxHeadless, the Remote Desktop Server">Section 7.1.2, &#8220;VBoxHeadless, the Remote Desktop Server&#8221;</a>.
        </p></li><li><p>
          <span><strong class="command">vboxwebsrv</strong></span>: The Oracle VM VirtualBox web service
          process which enables control of an Oracle VM VirtualBox host
          remotely. This is described in detail in the Oracle VM VirtualBox
          Software Development Kit (SDK) reference. See
          <a href="ch11.html" title="Chapter 11. Oracle VM VirtualBox Programming Interfaces">Chapter 11, <i>Oracle VM VirtualBox Programming Interfaces</i></a>.

      Internally, Oracle VM VirtualBox consists of many more or less separate
      components. You may encounter these when analyzing Oracle VM VirtualBox
      internal error messages or log files. These include the following:
    </p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
          IPRT: A portable runtime library which abstracts file access,
          threading, and string manipulation. Whenever Oracle VM VirtualBox
          accesses host operating features, it does so through this
          library for cross-platform portability.
        </p></li><li><p>
          VMM (Virtual Machine Monitor): The heart of the hypervisor.
        </p></li><li><p>
          EM (Execution Manager): Controls execution of guest code.
        </p></li><li><p>
          TRPM (Trap Manager): Intercepts and processes guest traps and
          exceptions.
        </p></li><li><p>
          HM (Hardware Acceleration Manager): Provides support for VT-x
          and AMD-V.
        </p></li><li><p>
          GIM (Guest Interface Manager): Provides support for various
          paravirtualization interfaces to the guest.
        </p></li><li><p>
          PDM (Pluggable Device Manager): An abstract interface between
          the VMM and emulated devices which separates device

          Oracle VM VirtualBox emulates a number of devices to provide the
          hardware environment that various guests need. Most of these
          are standard devices found in many PC compatible machines and
          widely supported by guest operating systems. For network and
          storage devices in particular, there are several options for
          the emulated devices to access the underlying hardware. These

          The "Main" component is special. It ties all the above bits

      Oracle VM VirtualBox enables software in the virtual machine to run
      directly on the processor of the host, but an array of complex
      techniques is employed to intercept operations that would
      interfere with your host. Whenever the guest attempts to do
      something that could be harmful to your computer and its data,
      Oracle VM VirtualBox steps in and takes action. In particular, for lots
      of hardware that the guest believes to be accessing,
      Oracle VM VirtualBox simulates a certain <span class="emphasis"><em>virtual</em></span>
      environment according to how you have configured a virtual
      machine. For example, when the guest attempts to access a hard
      disk, Oracle VM VirtualBox redirects these requests to whatever you have
      configured to be the virtual machine's virtual hard disk. This is
      normally an image file on your host.
    </p><p>
      Unfortunately, the x86 platform was never designed to be
      virtualized. Detecting situations in which Oracle VM VirtualBox needs to
      take control over the guest code that is executing, as described
      above, is difficult. To achieve this, Oracle VM VirtualBox uses
      <span class="emphasis"><em>hardware virtualization</em></span>.
    </p><p>
      Intel and AMD processors have support for hardware virtualization.
      This means that these processors can help Oracle VM VirtualBox to
      intercept potentially dangerous operations that a guest operating
      system may be attempting and also makes it easier to present
      virtual hardware to a virtual machine.
    </p><p>
      These hardware features differ between Intel and AMD processors.
      Intel named its technology VT-x, AMD calls theirs AMD-V. The Intel
      and AMD support for virtualization is very different in detail,
      but not very different in principle.
    </p><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title">Note</h3><p>
        On many systems, the hardware virtualization features first need
        to be enabled in the BIOS before Oracle VM VirtualBox can use them.
      </p></div><p>
      Enabling hardware virtualization is <span class="emphasis"><em>required</em></span>
      in the following scenarios:
    </p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
          Certain rare guest operating systems like OS/2 make use of
          very esoteric processor instructions. For virtual machines
          that are configured to use such an operating system, hardware
          virtualization is enabled automatically.
        </p></li><li><p>
          Oracle VM VirtualBox's 64-bit guest and multiprocessing (SMP)
          support both require hardware virtualization to be enabled.
          This is not much of a limitation since the vast majority of
          64-bit and multicore CPUs ship with hardware virtualization.
          The exceptions to this rule are some legacy Intel and AMD
          CPUs.
        </p></li></ul></div><div class="warning" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title">Warning</h3><p>
        Do not run other hypervisors, either open source or commercial
        virtualization products, together with Oracle VM VirtualBox. While
        several hypervisors can normally be
        <span class="emphasis"><em>installed</em></span> in parallel, do not attempt to
        <span class="emphasis"><em>run</em></span> several virtual machines from competing
        hypervisors at the same time. Oracle VM VirtualBox cannot track what
        another hypervisor is currently attempting to do on the same
        host, and especially if several products attempt to use hardware
        virtualization features such as VT-x, this can crash the entire
        host.

      hardware virtualization.
    </p></div><div class="sect1" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="hwvirt-details"></a>10.4. Details About Hardware Virtualization</h2></div></div></div><p>
      With Intel VT-x, there are two distinct modes of CPU operation:
      VMX root mode and non-root mode.
    </p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
          In root mode, the CPU operates much like older generations of
          processors without VT-x support. There are four privilege
          levels, called rings, and the same instruction set is
          supported, with the addition of several virtualization
          specific instruction. Root mode is what a host operating
          system without virtualization uses, and it is also used by a
          hypervisor when virtualization is active.
        </p></li><li><p>
          In non-root mode, CPU operation is significantly different.
          There are still four privilege rings and the same instruction
          set, but a new structure called VMCS (Virtual Machine Control
          Structure) now controls the CPU operation and determines how
          certain instructions behave. Non-root mode is where guest
          systems run.
        </p></li></ul></div><p>
      Switching from root mode to non-root mode is called "VM entry",
      the switch back is "VM exit". The VMCS includes a guest and host
      state area which is saved/restored at VM entry and exit. Most
      importantly, the VMCS controls which guest operations will cause
      VM exits.
    </p><p>
      The VMCS provides fairly fine-grained control over what the guests
      can and cannot do. For example, a hypervisor can allow a guest to
      write certain bits in shadowed control registers, but not others.
      This enables efficient virtualization in cases where guests can be
      allowed to write control bits without disrupting the hypervisor,
      while preventing them from altering control bits over which the
      hypervisor needs to retain full control. The VMCS also provides
      control over interrupt delivery and exceptions.
    </p><p>
      Whenever an instruction or event causes a VM exit, the VMCS
      contains information about the exit reason, often with
      accompanying detail. For example, if a write to the CR0 register
      causes an exit, the offending instruction is recorded, along with
      the fact that a write access to a control register caused the
      exit, and information about source and destination register. Thus
      the hypervisor can efficiently handle the condition without
      needing advanced techniques such as CSAM and PATM described above.
    </p><p>
      VT-x inherently avoids several of the problems which software
      virtualization faces. The guest has its own completely separate
      address space not shared with the hypervisor, which eliminates
      potential clashes. Additionally, guest OS kernel code runs at
      privilege ring 0 in VMX non-root mode, obviating the problems by
      running ring 0 code at less privileged levels. For example the
      SYSENTER instruction can transition to ring 0 without causing
      problems. Naturally, even at ring 0 in VMX non-root mode, any I/O
      access by guest code still causes a VM exit, allowing for device
      emulation.
    </p><p>
      The biggest difference between VT-x and AMD-V is that AMD-V
      provides a more complete virtualization environment. VT-x requires
      the VMX non-root code to run with paging enabled, which precludes
      hardware virtualization of real-mode code and non-paged
      protected-mode software. This typically only includes firmware and
      OS loaders, but nevertheless complicates VT-x hypervisor
      implementation. AMD-V does not have this restriction.
    </p><p>
      Of course hardware virtualization is not perfect. Compared to
      software virtualization, the overhead of VM exits is relatively
      high. This causes problems for devices whose emulation requires
      high number of traps. One example is a VGA device in 16-color
      mode, where not only every I/O port access but also every access
      to the framebuffer memory must be trapped.
    </p></div><div class="sect1" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="gimproviders"></a>10.5. Paravirtualization Providers</h2></div></div></div><p>
      Oracle VM VirtualBox enables the exposure of a paravirtualization
      interface, to facilitate accurate and efficient execution of
      software within a virtual machine. These interfaces require the
      guest operating system to recognize their presence and make use of
      them in order to leverage the benefits of communicating with the
      Oracle VM VirtualBox hypervisor.
    </p><p>
      Most modern, mainstream guest operating systems, including Windows
      and Linux, ship with support for one or more paravirtualization
      interfaces. Hence, there is typically no need to install
      additional software in the guest to take advantage of this
      feature.
    </p><p>
      Exposing a paravirtualization provider to the guest operating
      system does not rely on the choice of host platforms. For example,
      the <span class="emphasis"><em>Hyper-V</em></span> paravirtualization provider can
      be used for VMs to run on any host platform supported by
      Oracle VM VirtualBox and not just Windows.
    </p><p>
      Oracle VM VirtualBox provides the following interfaces:
    </p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
          <span class="bold"><strong>Minimal</strong></span>: Announces the
          presence of a virtualized environment. Additionally, reports
          the TSC and APIC frequency to the guest operating system. This

          This provider is recommended for Linux guests.
        </p></li><li><p>
          <span class="bold"><strong>Hyper-V</strong></span>: Presents a Microsoft
          Hyper-V hypervisor interface which is recognized by Windows 7

          reporting, guest debugging, guest crash reporting and relaxed
          timer checks. This provider is recommended for Windows guests.
        </p></li></ul></div></div><div class="sect1" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="nestedpaging"></a>10.6. Nested Paging and VPIDs</h2></div></div></div><p>
      In addition to normal hardware virtualization, your processor may
      also support the following additional sophisticated techniques:
    </p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
          Nested paging implements some memory management in hardware,
          which can greatly accelerate hardware virtualization since
          these tasks no longer need to be performed by the
          virtualization software.
        </p><p>
          With nested paging, the hardware provides another level of
          indirection when translating linear to physical addresses.
          Page tables function as before, but linear addresses are now
          translated to "guest physical" addresses first and not
          physical addresses directly. A new set of paging registers now
          exists under the traditional paging mechanism and translates
          from guest physical addresses to host physical addresses,
          which are used to access memory.
        </p><p>
          Nested paging eliminates the overhead caused by VM exits and
          page table accesses. In essence, with nested page tables the
          guest can handle paging without intervention from the
          hypervisor. Nested paging thus significantly improves
          virtualization performance.
        </p><p>
          On AMD processors, nested paging has been available starting
          with the Barcelona (K10) architecture. They now call it rapid
          virtualization indexing (RVI). Intel added support for nested
          paging, which they call extended page tables (EPT), with their
          Core i7 (Nehalem) processors.
        </p><p>
          If nested paging is enabled, the Oracle VM VirtualBox hypervisor can
          also use <span class="emphasis"><em>large pages</em></span> to reduce TLB usage
          and overhead. This can yield a performance improvement of up
          to 5%. To enable this feature for a VM, you use the
          <span><strong class="command">VBoxManage modifyvm --largepages</strong></span> command.
          See <a href="ch08.html#vboxmanage-modifyvm" title="8.8. VBoxManage modifyvm">Section 8.8, &#8220;VBoxManage modifyvm&#8221;</a>.
        </p><p>
          If you have an Intel CPU with EPT, please consult
          <a href="ch13.html#sec-rec-cve-2018-3646" title="13.4.1. CVE-2018-3646">Section 13.4.1, &#8220;CVE-2018-3646&#8221;</a> for security concerns
          regarding EPT.
        </p></li><li><p>
          On Intel CPUs, a hardware feature called Virtual Processor
          Identifiers (VPIDs) can greatly accelerate context switching
          by reducing the need for expensive flushing of the processor's
          Translation Lookaside Buffers (TLBs).
        </p><p>
          To enable these features for a VM, you use the
          <span><strong class="command">VBoxManage modifyvm --vtxvpid</strong></span> and
          <span><strong class="command">VBoxManage modifyvm --largepages</strong></span> commands.
